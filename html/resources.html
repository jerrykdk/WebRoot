      <h3>Motion Sensor/Accelerometer </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Motion sensors allow the iPhone to switch from a landscape to a portrait display as a result of the user manipulating the direction of the device. </li>
        <br>
        <li>A basic functional principle to a <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/sensors-that-make-iphone-so-cool-2000370" target="_blank">motion sensor</a> involves the transformation of the detection of motion into an electrical current. Detection of motion is achieved by measuring the optical change in the target field of view.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The majority of motion detectors are engineered to accurately access data on optical change up to 15 to 25 meters in length.</li>
        <br>
        <li>This feature will help my future mobile application users to switch from a landscape to portrait mode with only one move.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Fingerprint Sensor</h3>
      <p>Some iPhones have a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/localauthentication" target="_blank">fingerprint sensor</a> that can be used to unlock the phone and apps. It is embedded in the Home button and allows one to use a fingerprint to unlock the device rather than or in addition to using a passcode. It can also be used for in-app purchases. <br> <br> However, fingerprint technology still has some issues, such as the potential to be hacked, or of the device's not recognizing the fingerprint (for example, when the finger has been injured). Nevertheless, Apple states that their hardware-based security processor isolated from the rest of the system, and manages this data out of reach even of the operating system.

        <h3>FaceID</h3>
        <p>Some latest models of the iPhone come with a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avmetadatafaceobject/1386945-faceid" target="_blank">facial recognition sensor</a>, replacing the fingerprint sensor. The sensor works by projecting more than 30 000 dots on a face, which helps build a 3D map of the face. An infrared camera converts these dots into an image, which is compared to the data stored on the phone to unlock the device.
        </p>
                 
        <p>Aside from the biometric scanning operation itself, Face ID exhibits an <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/localauthentication/logging_a_user_into_your_app_with_face_id_or_touch_id" target="_blank">important difference</a> from Touch ID. When the app tries to use Touch ID, a system message asks the user to present a finger to scan. The user has time to think about and possibly abort the operation by canceling the prompt. When the app invokes Face ID, the device begins scanning the user’s face right away. </p>
